# 🗺️ US States Guessing Game

This is a fun interactive **Python turtle graphics game** where the user guesses all 50 US states.  
Every correct guess displays the state’s name on the map, while missed states are saved to a file for later practice.

## ✨ Features
- Displays a blank US map using **Turtle graphics**.  
- Prompts the user to type the name of a US state.  
- Correct guesses are marked on the map at their correct coordinates.  
- Typing **"Exit"** ends the game and creates a `remaining_states.csv` file listing unguessed states.
